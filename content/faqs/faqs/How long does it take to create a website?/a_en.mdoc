Creating a website is a creative process. As such, the amount of time it takes to create one varies on its expected functionality, how much feedback is given and how many changes are made after the initial concept.

Overall, it takes around 2 - 3 months of constant feedback and adjustments until a website is completed, from initial concepts to prototypes to the final product.
