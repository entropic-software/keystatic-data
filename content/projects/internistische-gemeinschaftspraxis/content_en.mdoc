## Introducing the New Website for the Internistische Gemeinschaftspraxis

We're thrilled to unveil the brand-new website for the German Internistische Gemeinschaftspraxis from Bad Saulgau who specializes in examination and treatment procedures from the entire field of internal medicine. The website was created with a focus on modernizing the online appearance of the clinic, with the upgraded UI and contact form being the biggest improvements over the old website, which last got updated in 2016.

## Designed for useability

A common trait of websites from the last decade is that, while they are certainly functional, editing and maintaining them is usually very rigorous. The same goes for the front-end of the website. While functional, it's design might have aged poorly or the layout might not be up to modern standards.

A lot of attention thus went into modernizing the backend infrastructure along with the website itself. We chose [Strapi](https://strapi.com) as the Content Management System because of its clean UI and rich variety of content types and possible inputs. Strapi provides the additional benefit of being a [headless CMS](https://www.netlify.com/blog/complete-guide-to-headless-cms/), which means that it acts purely as a content repository without generating any user-facing pages. This will allow for the front-end to be upgraded in the future, while the CMS itself can be carried over, meaning no data gets lost while migrating.
